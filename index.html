            <H1>
                Hop Island is quite the niftily unscrupulous game.
            </H1>
            <P>
                Bombarding you with puzzles like a <I>freight train </I>,<br/> it merely tests your unmatched skills of:<br/>
                
                    <UL>tapping left</UL>
                    <UL>tapping right</UL>
                    <UL>tapping up</UL>
                    <UL>tapping down</UL>
                    <UL>tapping z</UL>
                    <UL>tapping x</UL>
                    <Ul>tapping a</Ul>
                    <UL>and tapping s.</UL>
                <br/>
            </P>
            <hr>
            <H1>
                Bravo, with that attitude,
            </H1>
            <br/>
            <P>
                you'll leap through Hop Island like it's nothing.<br/>
            </P>
            <P>
                A rage game (not really), Hop Island will stare at you in the face <br/>with a sinister smile as you try to breach and wrangle your way through it's challenging and tear-inducing mind-rufflers. <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>Your eyes,<br/>
                at the edge of tears,<br/>
                will either be in a blissful awe or in complete disarray.<br/><br/>
                Hop Island is not as intense as you think it is, <br/> but for me, the developer, <br/> well, who cares?<br/><br/>
                The art thankfully is dated,<br/> as someone like me would call it,<br/> but the more pragmatic folks would call it pixel art.
            </P>

            <H1>
                If you're unconvininced of not being excited to play this utter trash,
            </H1>  
                <P> 
                    <br/> you should not visit <a>https://minidavid.itch.io</a> and you should not click on the follow button,<br/> but good for you because you don't really want to play it.<br/>
                    Again, you shouldn't play the demo, because you probably don't want to.<br/><br/>
                    If you did and it hurt, I'm deeply sorry.<br/><br/>
                    Thanks for reading, or more likely, pressing "END" on the numpad section and skipping to this bottom part.
                    Oh and also, one last thing:<br/>Hop Island doesn't contain a line of dialogue<br/>

                Hop Island's History and future
            </H1>
            <P>
                Hop Island started off as an Undertale clone with quips and humor.
            </P>
            <P>
                Slowly it warped into a strange puzzle game as its mechanics were finetuned.
            </P>
            <P>
                Still a work in progress, this game will contain a small non verbally told story as well as interesting puzzles (I think).
            </P>
